Here is the section where I will add links to podcasts that I am listening, and that helped me a lot to motivate myself. List of podcasts will not be in any ranked order. I really enjoy and recommend all of them, no matter how many I end up adding.

### **1. Coding Blocks**

These guys are really awesome. All three are very successful Software Engineers, and they know every little single thing when it comes to the topic of discussion. You can always hear different angles and really enjoy the conversation along the way. Every episode has detailed show notes where you can find links to resources mentioned in the episode.

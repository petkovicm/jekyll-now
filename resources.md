This page will be reserved for the recommendation of books, websites, and tutorials that I find very useful for personal development. I am going to be adding more as they come.

### Websites & Blogs

**[codeshare.co.uk](http://www.codeshare.co.uk/)**

A great resource for learning web development using MVC and Umbraco CMS. Author of this website, Paul Seal, is great at transferring knowledge, has a ton of very useful stuff on his website (check out "Tools" section) and every so often you can watch him code live on his [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/prjseal).

**[sungkim.co](http://www.sungkim.co/)**

One of the probably most active members of ```#codingblocks``` [slack channel](https://www.codingblocks.net/slack/) is Sung Kim, Software engineer from NY. He shares an enourmous passion for development, contribution to community, blogging, learning, and teaching. You can follow his journey on his blog, and maybe on twitch channel soon enough. 

**[UX myths](http://uxmyths.com/)**

"UX Myths collects the most frequent user experience misconceptions and explains why they don't hold true." 

**[Modern Analyst](http://www.modernanalyst.com/Home.aspx)**

By following they're [twitter account](https://twitter.com/ModernAnalyst), I found a couple of very useful articles on Business Analysis, which is essentially the core of my involvement in IT industry. Check them out if you are struggling to bring something fresh to the table as a BA.

### Courses & Personal Development

**[Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com)**

Learning platform with the subscription model. I personally have a yearly membership, and I think I am going to renew it soon. There is a couple of more options for me to investigate, but for now, I am really satisfied with the wide range of topics pluralsight covers. There is also a learning path type courses, where you literally go from zero to hero in a well-planned structure.

**[Udemy](http://www.udemy.com)**

Paid courses, a variety of topics. Every so often there is a promotion going, where all courses are $10 a piece. I can personally recommend [Mosh's](https://www.udemy.com/user/moshfeghhamedani/) courses on C#. He is an excellent tutor and can give you a lot of insights if you are a beginner.

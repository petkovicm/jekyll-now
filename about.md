I am an experienced business consultant with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry, skilled in Business Processes, CPQ, Workflow Applications, Communication, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Quality Management. My goal is to dive deeper into the technical part of consulting business and eventually become an "all-around player".

For that to happen, I have chosen a path of learning Software Development, and my weapons of choice are `.NET framework` and `Web development frameworks`! I plan to document my `from zero (but not really a zero) to hero` path by writing this blog and keeping myself motivated along the way. I also plan to write on some topics related to my regular job as a Business Analyst/Product Owner in MNC.

### More Information

Outside the programming world and IT industry, I’m a passionate NBA fan, podcast listener and recreational chess player.

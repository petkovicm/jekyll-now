I am an experienced business consultant with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry. Skilled in Business Processes, CPQ, Workflow Applications, Communication, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Quality Management. My goal is to dive deep into a technical part of consulting and eventually become a Solution Architect.

For that to happen, I have chosen a path of learning Software Development, and my weapon of choice is `.NET framework`! I plan to document my `from zero to hero` path by writing this blog and keeping myself motivated along the way. I also plan to write on some topics related to my regular job as a Business Analyst/Product Owner in IT industry.

### More Information

Outside the programming world and IT industry, Iâ€™m a passionate NBA fan, podcast listener and recreational chess player.
